#### Due to the backend changes, for container monitoring with OMS Agent for Linux and it is a fresh install, you will need to run this workaround. 

If this a fresh install, install the agent and onboard later by doing the following steps: 
1. Download the OMS Agent for Linux. Install the OMS Agent for Linux. 
	
	```sudo ./omsagent*.sh --install``` 

2. Onboard your OMS workspace.

	```sudo /opt/microsoft/omsagent/bin/omsadmin.sh -w <wsid> -s <key>``` 

If you have already installed and onboarded, re-onboard by doing the following steps:
1. Remove all the onboarded OMS workspace.  

	```sudo /opt/microsoft/omsagent/bin/omsadmin.sh -X```

2. Re-onboard your OMS workspace. 

	```sudo /opt/microsoft/omsagent/bin/omsadmin.sh -w <wsid> -s <key>```
